# ansible
Here I store the ansible configuration I need for my serverproject

A couple of weeks ago, I started a project in my "lab", where I want to build a distributed setup for PHP and Java applications, running serveral LXC containers on my server.

You can read all about what's happening on my site: serverblog.panikknopf.de .

Here I will share my ansible configuration and playbooks.

I hope, you will find it useful and use it, too.
